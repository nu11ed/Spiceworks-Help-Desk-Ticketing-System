# Spiceworks-Help-Desk-Ticketing-System

# Description 

<p> This project involved building a fully functional IT help desk environment using Spiceworks to simulate real-world technical support operations. I configured ticket categories, priorities, and workflows, then created and resolved multiple realistic support tickets—including WiFi connectivity issues, printer problems, laptop performance troubleshooting, and password resets. Each ticket followed a complete lifecycle with proper triage, troubleshooting steps, time tracking, internal notes, and documented resolutions. The project demonstrates my ability to manage incidents, communicate with users, and maintain organized and detailed technical documentation within a modern ticketing system. </p>
